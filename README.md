# verbs_plus.zil
A range of additional SYNTAXes with associated ROUTINEs to make life a little easier for the modern player.  People don't just want to ATTACK, they want to KICK and PUNCH and WHACK. 



To date (7th Oct 2020) i've added the following into verbs_plus so that they do not have to be added each time to new projects or butcher the original parser & verbs files.

ASK
As in ASK BOB ABOUT THE FISH

PRESS
As in PRESS THE RED BUTTON

USE
As in USE SPOON

KICK
HIT
PUNCH
BEAT
WHACK
Self-explanatory, and these were implemented after the kids playtested ... so no lewd comments about BEAT or WHACK please!

EXIT
As in EXIT ROOM or EXIT VEHICLE
